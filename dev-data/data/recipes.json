    "description": "Spirit, bitters, sugar, and water are the 4 ingredients needed for this most fundemental of cocktails.",
    "about": "The Old-Fashioned is as traditional as they come. A simple mix of spirits, sugar, bitters and water, it appears in 1806 as the first printed recipe for a cocktail. Other alcohols were permitted, but the whiskey or rye version of this combination, over ice, is what we now know as the Old Fashioned, thought to be named later that century after more elaborate new-fangled cocktails entered the canon. During Prohibition, the recipe veered into odd territory, adding fruit and cherries to distract from the available crude spirits. After repeal, it was the imposter version that stuck until the recent cocktail revival brought the original recipe back from the brink of extinction.",
    "instructions": "Combine all the ingredients in a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until chilled. Strain into a chilled rocks glass over fresh ice, preferably a large cube. If you’re in a rush, skip the mixing glass and just combine the ingredients in a rocks glass with a large ice cube and stir for 20 seconds. Garnish with an orange peel.",

    "description": "A sweet, crisp cousin to the margarita",
    "about": "The Mexican Firing Squad is one of the many cocktails documented by world traveler, cocktail writer and historian Charles H. Baker. The drink is recorded in his Gentleman’s Companion, Volume II as having been discovered at the La Cucaracha Bar in Mexico City in 1937. A dry formula, the Firing Squad is almost a rickey with the addition of grenadine to sweeten only slightly. Some modern versions include the addition of soda to create a longer, cooling drink.",
    "instructions": "Combine the tequila, lime juice, grenadine, and bitters in a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously for 5 - 10 seconds. Strain into a collins or highball glass filled with fresh ice. Top with club soda and garnish with a lime wheel.",
